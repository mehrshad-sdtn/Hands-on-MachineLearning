# Hands-on-MachineLearning
practice codes and examples from the book Hands on Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron (ed.2)
### [chapter 2](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Hands-on-MachineLearning/tree/master/2)
In this chapter California housing price problem is tackled, along with it I learned some useful preprocessing techniques and some useful functions from Scikit-Learn

### [chapter 3](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Hands-on-MachineLearning/tree/master/3)
In this chapter first MNIST dataset is tackled using SVM and SGD classifiers. <br/>
As a practice I took part [Titanic Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) and got 78.5% accuracy.
