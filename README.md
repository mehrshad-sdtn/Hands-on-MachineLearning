# Hands-on-MachineLearning
practice codes and examples from the book Hands on Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron (ed.2)
### [chapter 2](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Hands-on-MachineLearning/tree/master/2)
In this chapter California housing price problem is tackled, along with it I learned some useful preprocessing techniques and some useful functions from Scikit-Learn

### [chapter 3](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Hands-on-MachineLearning/tree/master/3)
In this chapter first MNIST dataset is tackled using SVM and SGD classifiers. <br/>
As a practice I took part [Titanic Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) and got 78.5% accuracy (with SVM)


### [chapter 4](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Hands-on-MachineLearning/tree/master/4)
This chapter goes in depth into training models in ML, it explains how Gradient Descent works and what are different types of it, what is regularization,
Logistic regression and softmax regression and how to implement those algorithms from scratch.

### [chapter 5](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/Hands-on-MachineLearning/tree/master/5)
some svm visualization on dummy data
